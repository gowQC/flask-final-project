# Repository for final project for "Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask"

This project utilizes both Flask and the Watson NLP library to generate a simple web application that receives user input and determines the emotional tone of any provided text. When the text field is left blank, a rejection message displays.
The server.py file has also been optimized in accordance with Pylint - a Python static code analysis tool.
